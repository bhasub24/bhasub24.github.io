I'm a second year Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California, Davis. I am currently working as a researcher in computational imaging in Yang Research Laboratory under Professor Weijian Yang. My focus is on building self supervised denoising algorithms for functional imaging modality.

I recieved my BTech in Instrumentationa and Control Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli and previously worked as a Software Engineer in Deloitte.

I am currently exploring the intersection of machine intelligence and human augmentation. My work spans deep learning, inference, self-supervised learning, and system design. I believe in building tools that empower people and push the boundaries of what we can understand.
