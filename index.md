I'm a second year Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California, Davis. I am currently working as a researcher in computational imaging in Yang Research Laboratory under Professor Weijian Yang. My focus is on building self supervised denoising algorithms for functional imaging modality.

I recieved my B-Tech in Instrumentationa and Control Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli and previously worked as a Software Engineer in Deloitte.

I’m deeply interested in machine intelligence as a means for human intelligence amplification. I believe that future research should not aim solely for raw performance, but instead prioritize building systems whose primary purpose is to make us better thinkers, learners, and creators.

My long-term vision is to develop intelligent systems that deeply understand us, how we think, how we feel, how we learn and use that understanding to accelerate human growth and potential. Achieving this requires strength in two frontiers:

1. On the computational side, we must advance deep learning, especially in areas like mechanistic interpretability, which helps us understand how these systems work, and self-supervised learning, which enables models to learn like humans through observation, prediction, and interaction.

2. On the human side, we must ground our models in the richness of human cognition, drawing insights from psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral science to align AI systems with how people actually think and grow.

I’ve often imagined what it must have felt like when the first telephone bridged vast physical distances, or when X-ray allowed medicine to see the invisible. These moments didn’t just introduce new tools—they reshaped the human experience. I feel incredibly fortunate to be alive in a time when artificial intelligence promises a transformation of even greater magnitude, one that could reshape not only how we work, but how we understand and extend ourselves.
