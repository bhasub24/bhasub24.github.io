Hi, I'm Bharath Subramanian. I’m a second-year M.S. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC Davis. I currently work in the Computational Imaging Lab, advised by Prof. Weijian Yang, where I develop self-supervised and zero-shot denoising algorithms for functional microscopy (calcium and voltage imaging).

Broadly, I’m interested in self-supervised learning, inverse problems, information theory, statistical learning theory, and reinforcement learning. Currently, I’m exploring how to transfer knowledge from simulation to real microscopy denoising, how synthetic data can improve self-supervised models, and how to achieve robust generalization under distribution shifts.
